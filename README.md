# HNS-Programmers-SmoothSort
This project is about Smooth Sort. In computer science, smoothsort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm. A variant of heapsort, it was invented and published by Edsger Dijkstra in 1981. Like heapsort, smooth sort is an in-place algorithm with an upper bound of O(n log n), but it is not a stable sort.
